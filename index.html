    <p>False accusations were made against Richard Stallman in September 2019.
      Although others pointed out the mistakes, the stage had been set for a
      cascade of <a
                   href="debunking-false-accusations-against-richard-stallman.html">defamatory</a>
      reactions that followed and spread like wildfire.
      This was fueled by misquotes and distortion of events in mainstream
      <a
        href="say-it-with-a-meme.html#defamation">headlines</a>, blogs, and
      social media, leading ultimately to Stallman's resignation from his
      positions at
      <abbr title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</abbr>
      and the <abbr title="Free Software Foundation">FSF</abbr>.</p>

    <p>A new wave of attacks was launched when the reinstatement of Richard
      Stallman in the FSF Board of Directors was announced on March 21, 2021.</p>

    <p>Free software and free culture advocates around the world were
      outraged at the injustice. Members of the community at large felt hurt
      and looked for ways to voice their pain and repair the damage caused.</p>

    <p>Some published accurate <a
                                 href="articles-in-support-of-richard-stallman.html#external-articles">
      articles</a>, objectively and meticulously showcasing the facts. Many
      others wrote short <a
                           href="comments-in-support-of-richard-stallman.html">comments</a> in blogs
      and news websites pointing out the errors that were being swiftly propagated
      by copy paste &ldquo;authors.&rdquo; Still others sent letters of concern
      to the FSF.</p>

    <p>A petition<a id="ref1-rev" href="#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> was launched to
      condemn bad press and demand apologies to Stallman from journalists who
      knowingly or incompetently spread false information. It was to no avail.
      Journalists never corrected their erroneous headlines, let alone apologize.
      The petition is now stale (and it requires JavaScript.) Better to sign the
      <a href="https://rms-support-letter.github.io/" class="external">letter of support</a>.
    </p>

    <p>We have become sadly familiar with the terms &ldquo;misinformation and
      disinformation&rdquo; and the need to critically examine the agendas and
      mindsets motivating these campaigns as well as check the facts behind
      their assertions. To our collective social woe, <strong>disinformation succeeds
      because so many people care deeply about injustice but do not take the
      time to study the facts before passing along or acting on disinformation.</strong></p>

    <p>Because many of those who attack Stallman &mdash;or even supporters
      who speak up for him&mdash; may only have a partial notion of who he is
      and all that he has contributed towards a more fair and just society,
      we start our story there. <strong><a href="who-is-richard-stallman.html">Who is Richard Stallman?</a></strong></p>
